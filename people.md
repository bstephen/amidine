![](assets/images/bs_bio_300.jpg){: height="150px" width="103px"} The AMIDiNe project is led by [Dr Bruce Stephen](https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/stephenbrucedr/), a Senior Research Fellow within the Institute for Energy and the Environment at the University of Strathclyde.  In the past 20 years, his research output in the areas of artificial intelligence and distributed computing applications have been supported with funding from both industrial and government sources. This research has spanned multiple disciplines, resulting in the design, implementation and deployment of software solutions to industrial problems that automate condition assessment, anomalous condition detection and simulate future behaviours of complex systems. In May 2009, following 3 years as technical lead for data analytics on a £4.75M Scottish Government funded livestock welfare research programme, Dr Stephen co-founded Silent Herdsman Ltd, commercialising the resulting research for a global market. Since 2009, his research has focused mainly on complex dependency modelling in renewable energy systems and understanding energy end usage, through participation in UK regulator Ofgem’s Energy Demand Research Project where he provided data analytics expertise to supplier Scottish Power Energy Retail, the EPSRC’s Supergen HiDEF project, and as an investigator on both the EPSRC BuildTEDDI APAtSCHE project (EP/K002708/1), the EPSRC/ESC TESA (EP/R002312/1) project, the EPSRC AGILE (EP/S003088/1) project and the FP7 ORIGIN project (FP7 grant agreement No 314742), developing a community energy management system for the latter along with the data analytics for local demand forecasting. Dr Stephen is currently joint lead of two core research themes in the Power Networks Demonstration Centre: Power System Asset Management and Future Networks & Demand Side Management, where he has specified and is currently overseeing industry led innovation projects with partners SPEN, SSE, UKPN, Vodafone and CISCO. 

Leader of AMIDiNe Work Package 1, Stuart Galloway, is Professor of Compact Power Systems in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at University of Strathclyde, where he leads research groups in Novel Electrical Systems and in Data Analytics and his research is concerned with multi-domain modelling of micro-grid applications for smart energy, and behavioural change. He was PI on the EPSRC/ESC TESA (EP/R002312/1) project, that with energy data at its centre, informed on opportunities for future energy supply arrangements at the local, decentralised and neighbourhood scales, EPSRC APAtSCHE project (EP/K002708/1), that investigated the technical and social issues surrounding energy, joint PI on EPSRC AGILE (EP/S003088/1) that will investigate the distributed energy market bundled DER services,  and Co-I on grants, Supergen+ for HubNet (EP/M015025/1) and Realising Transition Pathways (EP/K005316/1). International research (EU ORIGIN, EnergyMare) and on a number of research projects that involve a significant industrial collaboration. He is deputy director of the Rolls-Royce UTC in Electrical Power Systems and has recently been appointed to the directorate of the ClimateXChange Institute in Edinburgh.  He is an editorial board member for the IET in Electrical Systems for Transportation and for Generation Transmission and Distribution. He recently secured funded research projects with The Data Lab and National Physical Laboratory to help establish the value of reliable and frequent electrical systems data to consumers, utilities and SMEs.

Leading AMIDiNe Work Package 2, David Wallom (Co-I) is Associate Professor and Associate Director – Innovation of the Oxford e-Research Centre (OeRC), where he leads two different research groups, Energy & Environmental Informatics and Advanced e-Infrastructure & Cloud Computing. He has led OeRC participation in 50 research projects in areas such as Cloud utilisation, Smart Energy Grids, Research data management, Green IT, ICT security and institutional repositories. This has included funding by RCUK, InnovateUK and EC in the area of Energy informatics. Including on the transition of the current energy network at the distribution level to a smart system bringing computation and data as a service to DMS(EC FP7 HiPerDNO), communications and data systems planning for the introduction of smart metering for functionality beyond billing and analytics to consider the impacts of new tariffs (EPSRC Advanced Dynamic Energy Pricing and Tariffs, EP/I000194/1), the intersection of energy consumption and business practices in the retail sector (Working with Information, Creation of Knowledge, and Energy Strategy Deployment (WICKED) in Non-Domestic Buildings, EP/L024357/1) and developments of methods to utlise all available data from smart meters to tackle energy theft (InnovateUK, A Different Approach to Smart Meter Data Insight against Energy Theft). Prof Wallom is a board member of the HEFCE Institute for Environmental Analytics, bringing earth observation and other environmental data together to create business impact and value. He is a board member of Smart Oxford, a county, city, industry and academia venture to create a smarter region.

[Jethro Browell](http://www.jethrobrowell.com/) (Co-I) is a Research Fellow within the Institute for Energy and Environment at the University of Strathclyde, an EPSRC-UKRI Innovation Fellow ([EP/R023484/1](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/R023484/1)) and leads AMIDiNe Work Package 3. His research spans energy forecasting from development of novel statical methodologies through to forecast end-use and decision science. He has been supported by funding from both government and industrial sources, notably from SSE, ScottishPower and Wood Group via the UoS TIC Low Carbon Power and Energy programme where is has been PI and Co-I of numerous projects related to forecasting with an emphasis on applications to electricity market participation and power system operation. He is active in the International Energy Agency, recently co-authoring a [recommended practice for forecast evaluation](http://www.ieawindforecasting.dk/Publications/RecommendedPractice).

Undertaking modelling of power systems at the low voltage level, Dr Rory Telford is technical lead on Work Package 1. Prior to working on AMIDiNe, Rory was a ClimateXChange Fellow for the Scottish Government.

Joanna Sobon supports Work Package 1 data curation and power system modelling activities. Joanna is currently finishing off a PhD in optimal planning for electrical energy storage assets.
