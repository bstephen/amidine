The main four main scripts are

- `intensity_smfcv2.Rmd` which generates forecasts of the daily peak intensity
- `timing_smfcv2.Rmd` which generates forecasts of the daily peak timing
- `halfhourly_smfc.Rmd` which generates forecasts of the half hourly demand
- `halfhourly_mixture_smfc.Rmd` which generates the final forecasts as a fusion between the previous three script outputs

**Note that the fourth script must always be ran last**

The other script is for generating plots in the paper.
